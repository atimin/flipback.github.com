My name is Aleksey Timin. I'm programmer and integrator
of control process systems from Russia. In despite of my profession,
I spend much time and energy to learn others (not related with PCS) sciences
and technologies. In circle of my interests:

1. **Ruby**. It's my favorite programing language and it's a main tool
of implementation my ideas.

2. **Open Source**. I got sick this when I was student. Now I have some open source
projects about which I will tell [here](/about/projects/).

3. **Robotics**. To create robots - it is my childish dream. Recently I have started to go to it.

4. **English**. I'm Russian and I'm living in Russia. I have started to learn English in last year
and this blog is result of my training. I hope you will not be a very rigorous for my writing.

5. **Piano**. I have a musical education and as hobby I play piano. 


This blog is devoted those interests and I hope that it will be helpful and interesting.

Thanks, flipback.
